Description: Quilt Linked Data server FastCGI web application
 Quilt is a FastCGI application which implements a Linked Data server. It
 accepts requests from clients, and processes them by performing simple
 SPARQL queries before serialising the results in the format requested
 (e.g., Turtle, N-Triples, RDF/XML). HTML output is template-driven, using
 a limited subset of the Liquid templating language.
