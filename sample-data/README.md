This directory contains sample data which can be used with the `file` engine
to test if it's working.

The data itself is taken from [dbpedialite](http://www.dbpedialite.org), which
is a Linked Open Data interface to the Wikipedia API, and from
[Wikidata](http://www.wikidata.org).

The `file` engine reads Turtle files from a configured directory, requesting
`index.ttl` at the root.
