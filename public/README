This directory is intended to be configured as your web server's 'document
root' when used with Quilt -- files present in this directory should be
served directly, rather than passing the request to the Quilt FastCGI
application.

Typically, this is accomplished through a mechanism such as Apache's
RewriteCond/RewriteRule.
